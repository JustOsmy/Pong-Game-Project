# Pong-Game-Project
Pong Game final project for class Math-130
Pong Game is a modern take on the classic arcade game, designed for 1 or 2 players. Players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth, aiming to score points by getting the ball past their opponent. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and JavaFX-based GUI development.

# Wireframe

Two paddles (left and right).
A ball that moves and bounces off walls and paddles.
A scoreboard is at the top of the screen.
